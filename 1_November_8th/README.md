# âœ… Rules 

Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).

### ðŸ§© Game Input
Your program must read the data from the standard input and write the result on the standard output.

#### ðŸ“¥ Input
Line 1: N, the number of temperatures to analyze

Line 2: A string with the N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526

#### ðŸ“¤ Output
Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.
#### ðŸ’¥ Constraints
0 â‰¤ N < 10000
